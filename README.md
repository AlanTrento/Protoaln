# Protoaln Library

Protoaln is a library designed to facilitate message transmission and reception using the LoRa UART module. The library includes features for performing checksum calculations to ensure message integrity during serial communication.

## Tools Used

- Arduino IDE
- LoRa UART Module E220-900T22D
- Protoaln Library (self-developed)
- ESP32

## Project Requirements

- Arduino/ESP32 board
- LoRa UART Module E220-900T22D or compatible
- Basic knowledge of Arduino programming and serial communication

## Project Demo

The Protoaln library enables efficient and simple data transmission and reception using the LoRa UART module. By performing internal checksum calculations, it ensures the reliability of the transmitted messages.
